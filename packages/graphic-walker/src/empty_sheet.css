/* 
 * This file is empty and importing it causes no side effect

 * GraphicWalker starts using encapsuled css styles since v0.2.10
 * so it's no more necessary to explicitly import a styled file
 * from the production directory.
 * This file will be temporarily kept to avoid breaking compiling
 * while trying to import the out-dated style file.
